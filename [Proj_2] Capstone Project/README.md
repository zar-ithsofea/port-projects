Second milestone after finishing my 2-months intensive training to be a Junior Data Scientist. The project is done with my coursemates as well. Given the timeframe to
complete this project was 2 days, it might be a bit underdeveloped in certain parts. I'm looking to fix the machine learning part in the future. Overall, we realized we 
do have the basics covered but still tons more to learn and improve. Looking forward to what the future holds!
