#### Personal journal
This was my first ever project done with a few classmates about a month after writing our first line of codes in class! The project is mainly for us to reinforce our learning 
in the form of a 'real-world' context. We had fun figuring out a lot of new things outside of our classes as well as a bit overwhelming to discover that there's a lot
to be imrpoved on. But we'll be sure to make it one day!
